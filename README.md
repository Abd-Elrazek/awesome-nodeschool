> üè´ List of awesome things for NodeSchool mentors and students.

[NodeSchool][nodeschool] is an open source project run by volunteers with two goals: to create high quality programming curriculum and to host community learning events.

This list collects useful resources for those who want to find NodeSchool in their city, host a new chapter or create an interesting workshopper.

## Terms

For better understanding of NodeSchool's internal organization, let's take a look at few important terms:

### NodeSchool ‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶ is a loosely organized, international github organization with only one goal: Make it easy to learn Node.js together in a friendly environment.

### NodeSchool event ‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ is usually free (or with little cost), open community event. Anybody can attend to study Node.js in one fashion or another. NodeSchool events can happen outside of a chapter! If there is a free, open event where you can study Node.js you can put it on the list. NodeSchool events have freedom of choice in how to study Node.js together: studying workshoppers, creating workshoppers, using online tutorials, reading Node.js books, having presentations, etc.

### NodeSchool Core member ‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ is a person that contributed a significant amount to the NodeSchool and/or we feel works in the best interest of NodeSchool. You can ask to become a core member if you feel you want to be one! It comes with more permissions on the project in exchange for more volunteer work.

### Chapter ‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ is a place where at least one (but preferably more) NodeSchool events happen. Chapters are based on _their geolocation_ (not on any other structure!) and are usually setup for an area that is easy to reach with public transport within approximately 40min. Usually that means one Chapter per city.

### Chapter organizer ‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ is a GitHub organization member that can be talked to when there is a question about a Chapter. Other than that: there is no difference to a Chapter member!

### Chapter member ‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ is a GitHub organization member that helps organizing NodeSchool events. A member has access to the chapter‚Äôs homepage and can close issues. We expect members to accept other, willing volunteers with open arms into their chapter and ask for help if they need something.

### Workshopper ‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ is a tutorial that can be installed using [NPM][npm]. Either a CLI tool or electron app or web server. For example: [`javascripting`][javascripting] or [`learnyounode`][learnyounode].

## Organization

NodeSchool is a decentralized organization. The only difference between other contributors and the core-team is that the core team has more permissions to add/remove people. They should only be necessary to get things done in rare cases. Other than that the core members do the same thing that all contributors do: only what they are interested in.
